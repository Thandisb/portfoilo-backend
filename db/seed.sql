I didn’t even get nothing to drink. My meal came up to $80 for nothing. $40 for 4 ribs is ridiculous. I couldn’t even enjoy my food. They also gave themselves a tip even though I got no waiter service. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this place to friends and family.', false, 1, 1),
('26', 'Ashleigh', 'Slight Letdown', 'Quaint little neighborhood spot in Vinegar Hill. I have not been since before the pandemic, so I was really looking forward to this visit. We were seated in the garden which was perfect, given the weather and cool breeze. The servers were attentive and very nice. The brunch menu only had a handful of options. They only serve coffee no espresso drinks, so I opted for a cold brew which was quite refreshing. Unfortunately the rest of the food was just okay. The omelette was made well but lacking flavor. The egg and cheese sandwich was alright. The sourdough pancake was quite unique, more of a French toast style pancake. Unfortunately the mix of flavors was a little off, with butter, syrup, tart strawberries and salt. I may have to come back and try the lunch or dinner menu, but not for brunch.', true, 1, 5),
